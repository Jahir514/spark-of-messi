                                    <p>Why do nations assemble, and peoples plot vain things;
                                        kings of the earth take their stand, and regents intrigue together against the
                                        LORD
                                        and against His anointed?
                                        “Let us break the cords of their yoke, shake off their ropes from us!”
                                        He who is enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord mocks at them.
                                        Then He speaks to them in anger, terrifying them in His rage,
                                        “But I have installed My king on Zion, My holy mountain!”
                                        Let me tell of the decree: the LORD said to me, “You are My son, I have fathered
                                        you
                                        this day.
                                        Ask it of Me, and I will make the nations your domain; your estate, the limits
                                        of
                                        the earth.
                                        You can smash them with an iron mace, shatter them like potter’s ware.”
                                        So now, O kings, be prudent; accept discipline, you rulers of the earth!
                                        Serve the LORD in awe; tremble with fright,

                                        of
                                        the earth.
                                        You can smash them with an iron mace, shatter them like potter’s ware.”
                                        So now, O kings, be prudent; accept discipline, you rulers of the earth!
                                        Serve the LORD in awe; tremble with fright,
                                        pay homage in good faith, lest He be angered, and your way be doomed in the mere
                                        flash of His anger. Happy are all who take refuge in Him.
                                    </p>
